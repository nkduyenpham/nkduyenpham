 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
In 2019, I started my journey with a unique perspective - as a recent graduate from university. I had just completed my academic studies and was ready to embark on a career in the field of digital marketing. However, it was during this time that I stumbled upon an exciting opportunity to become the administrator for my company's website. This role introduced me to the vast and fascinating world of coding.

In 2021, I decided to take my coding journey to the next level by transitioning into a front-end developer role. This period was transformative as I delved into various programming languages and technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, WordPress, and Bootstrap. During this time, I also began to explore the realms of React and Node.js, broadening my skills and knowledge.

By 2022, I had made significant progress in my career and was recognized for my dedication and hard work. I was promoted to the position of Quality Assurance (QA) for the Front-End Developer Team, where I continued to fine-tune my expertise and contribute to the team's success.

Fast forward to 2023, and I find myself on an exciting new chapter of my coding journey. This year, I have set my sights on deepening my understanding of Python, diving into data structures and algorithms (DSA), mastering object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, and exploring web frameworks like Flask and Django. This phase represents my ongoing commitment to growth and learning.

My journey has been a progression of continuous curiosity, skill development, and career advancement. I'm excited to see where this journey will lead me in the future, as I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise in the ever-evolving world of technology.
